  "TDtext1": "Why is eye tracking?",
  "TDtext2": "Eye tracking is the process of measuring either the point of gaze (where one is looking) or the motion of an eye relative to the head.",
  "TDtext3": "An eye tracker is a device for measuring eye positions and eye movement.",
  "TDtext4": "Eye trackers are used in research on the visual system, in psychology, in psycholinguistics, marketing, as an input device for human-computer interaction, and in product design.",
  "TDtext5": "How to analyze",
  "TDtext6": "Data preprocessing is performed by cropping the user's face and eyes based on the input photo. The model then divides the face frame into grid units and finds the coordinates of the right and left eyes to find out where the user is looking.",
  "TDtext7": "According to the paper, performance and precision when using the model as a tablet is about 2.3 cm. It is very meaningful that tracking is possible with only a face photo, but the accuracy tends to be somewhat lower. Therefore, continuous research is needed to advance model performance.",
