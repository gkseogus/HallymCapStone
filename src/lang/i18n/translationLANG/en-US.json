  "TDtext6First": "D",
  "TDtext6": "ata preprocessing is performed by cropping the user's face and eyes based on the input photo. The model then divides the face frame into grid units and finds the coordinates of the right and left eyes to find out where the user is looking.",
  "TDtext7First":"A",
  "TDtext7": "ccording to the paper, performance and precision when using the model as a tablet is about 2.3 cm. It is very meaningful that tracking is possible with only a face photo, but the accuracy tends to be somewhat lower. Therefore, continuous research is needed to advance model performance.",
